postJSON.gs
-----------

Apps Script for Google Spreadsheets that sends a range of data to a remote service as JSON.
Comes with a hook to send edited spreadsheet rows to a remote service.

Handy for doing a quick admin UI to tabulated data.
Doesn't have anything for loading data from a remote server into the spreadsheet, 
so not so handy for maintaining consistency between a remote DB and a spreadsheet.
